You previously asked me to "revoies le design complet du mode claire rend le plus pro et cool et dynamique je veux que le design soit claire et les ecriture soit visible" (revise the complete design of the light mode to make it more professional, cool, and dynamic, with clear design and visible writing), which I have completed.

Now you are asking to "elimine mode claire puisque c'est pas normale" (eliminate light mode since it's not normal).

This is a direct contradiction to your previous request. Could you please clarify what you mean by "eliminate light mode" and "c'est pas normale"?

Do you want to:
1.  **Remove the ability to switch to light mode entirely, always enforcing dark mode?** (This would involve removing the theme toggle button and always setting the theme to 'dark' in the code.)
2.  **Remove all light mode specific styling, effectively making light mode look identical to dark mode?**
3.  **Revert all changes made to light mode and only keep the dark mode?** (This would imply I should revert the last commit that refined the light mode design).
4.  **Something else?**

Please be precise about what you want to achieve with the theme functionality.
je veux seulement le mode dark iniale ne mets plus de mode
